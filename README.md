you roll to win the game and what makes this **Roha_tenzies** different from any other tenzies game is that the face of the dice is not just a number 
it is a dot like it is on a real die and it has a level of appereciation depending on the number of scrolls you do and the the amount of time you 
spent to finish that round*

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
